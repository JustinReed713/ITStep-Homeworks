                Ford Motor Company is an American multinational automaker that has its main headquarters in
                Dearborn,
                Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The
                company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand and most luxury cars under
                the
                Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the
                United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors.[5] It also has joint-ventures in China (Changan
                Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), Turkey (Ford Otosan), and Russia
                (Ford
                Sollers). The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family;
                they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.
                Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an
                industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving
                assembly
                lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries
                Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to Tata Motors of India in
                March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010.[7] In 2011, Ford discontinued
                the
                Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada,
                Mexico,
                and the Middle East since 1938.
                Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the fifth-largest in the
                world (behind Toyota, VW, Hyundai-Kia and General Motors) based on 2015 vehicle production. At the
                end
                of 2010, Ford was the fifth largest automaker in Europe.[8] The company went public in 1956 but the
                Ford
                family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent voting rights.[9][4] During the
                financial crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, it was close to bankruptcy, but it has since
                returned to profitability.[10] Ford was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the
                2018
                Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion.[11] In 2008, Ford produced
                5.532
                million automobiles[12] and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities
                worldwide.

                History
                <br>
                20th century
                <br>
                Henry Ford (ca. 1919)
                <br>
                A 1910 Model T, photographed in Salt Lake City
                Henry Ford's first attempt at a car company under his own name was the Henry Ford Company on
                November 3,
                1901, which became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to
                his
                name.[13] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 in cash
                from
                twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company).
                The
                first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen to assuage investors'
                fears
                that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years,
                the
                company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later its factory on
                Piquette
                Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts
                made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade, the company would lead the
                world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of
                the
                part production in-house in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era.[citation
                needed]
                <br>
                Henry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one
                of
                the world's largest and most profitable companies. It has been in continuous family control for over
                100
                years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[citation needed]
                <br>
                The first gasoline powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Carl Benz
                (Benz
                Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for
                the
                middle class, to which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line
                in
                1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.[citation needed]
                <br>
                Between 1903 and 1908, Ford produced the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S. Hundreds or a few
                thousand
                of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which
                totalled
                millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car
                with
                safety glass in the windshield.[14] Ford launched the first low-priced car with a V8 engine in
                1932.[citation needed]
                <br>
                In an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, Ford
                created
                the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor
                Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment
                of
                the automobile market.[citation needed]
                <br>
                In 1929, Ford was contracted by the government of the Soviet Union to set up the Gorky Automobile
                Plant
                in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the
                industrialisation of that country.[15]
                <br>
                Ford Germany, Ford's subsidiary in Germany, produced military vehicles and other equipment for Nazi
                Germany's war effort. Some of Ford's operations in Germany at the time were run using forced labor.
                <br>
                The creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan in 1951, doing unfettered basic
                research,
                led to Ford's unlikely involvement in superconductivity research. In 1964, Ford Research Labs made a
                key
                breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID.[16]
                <br>
                Ford offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which included such innovations as a standard
                deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, for the first time in a car, rear seatbelts, and an
                optional padded dash.[17] Ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957, and, in
                the
                same year, offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car.[citation needed]
                <br>
                In late 1955, Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division. This
                division
                was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous Continental Mark II. At the same time,
                the
                Edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year. Due to
                limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster, Ford merged Lincoln, Mercury, and Edsel
                into
                "M-E-L," which reverted to "Lincoln-Mercury" after Edsel's November 1959 demise.[citation needed]
                <br>
                The Ford Mustang was introduced in April 17, 1964 during New York World's Fair.[18] In 1965, Ford
                introduced the seat belt reminder light.[citation needed]
                <br>
                With the 1980s, Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world. During the
                1980s,
                Ford began using the advertising slogan, "Have you driven a Ford, lately?" to introduce new
                customers to
                their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994 respectively, Ford also
                acquired Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin.[19] During the mid- to late 1990s, Ford continued to sell
                large
                numbers of vehicles, in a booming American economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel
                prices.[citation needed]
                <br>
                With the dawn of the new century, legacy health care costs, higher fuel prices, and a faltering
                economy
                led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate
                profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through Ford Motor Credit Company.[20]
                <br>
                21st century
                <br>
                William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford, serves as the executive chairman at the board
                of
                Ford Motor Company
                By 2005, both Ford and GM's corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status,[21] as a result of
                high
                U.S. health care costs for an aging workforce, soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an
                over dependence on declining SUV sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased
                "incentives" (in the form of rebates or low interest financing) to offset declining demand.[22] In
                the
                latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President Mark
                Fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the Plan, named
                The
                Way Forward, at the December 7, 2005, board meeting of the company and it was unveiled to the public
                on
                January 23, 2006. "The Way Forward" included resizing the company to match market realities,
                dropping
                some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, closing 14 factories and
                cutting 30,000 jobs.[23]
                <br>
                Ford moved to introduce a range of new vehicles, including "Crossover SUVs" built on unibody car
                platforms, rather than more body-on-frame chassis. In developing the hybrid electric powertrain
                technologies for the Ford Escape Hybrid SUV, Ford licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies[24] to
                avoid patent infringements.[25] Ford announced that it will team up with electricity supply company
                Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine the future of plug-in hybrids in terms of how home and
                vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year
                project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and
                SCE
                will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some
                of
                the vehicles will be evaluated "in typical customer settings", according to Ford.[26][27]
                <br>
                William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname "Bill"), was
                appointed executive chairman in 1998, and also became chief executive officer of the company in
                2001,
                with the departure of Jacques Nasser, becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the
                company
                since the retirement of his uncle, Henry Ford II, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company
                Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's
                motorsport
                involvement. Upon the retirement of president and chief operations officer Jim Padilla in April
                2006,
                Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named Alan Mulally as
                president and CEO, with Ford continuing as executive chairman. In December 2006, the company raised
                its
                borrowing capacity to about $25 billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as
                collateral.[28]
                Chairman Bill Ford has stated that "bankruptcy is not an option".[29] Ford and the United Auto
                Workers,
                representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract
                settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree
                health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a
                company-funded, independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust to shift
                the
                burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This
                arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford
                contributed its entire current liability (estimated at approximately US$5.5 billion as of December
                31,
                2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid US$500 million of its future liabilities to the fund.
                The
                agreement also gives hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit
                to
                substantial investments in most of its factories.
                <br>
                The automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7 billion,[30] and
                estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009.[31] However, Ford surprised Wall
                Street
                in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a $750 million profit. Despite the gains, the company
                finished
                the year with a $2.7 billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at Volvo.[32]
                <br>
                On June 2, 2008, Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors for $2.3
                billion.[33][34]
                <br>
                During congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., and in a show of support,
                Ford's
                Alan Mulally stated that "We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must
                prepare
                ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions". Mulally went on to state
                that
                "The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford" and that Ford Motor
                Company's supports both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in
                the
                face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis.[35][36] Together, the three companies
                presented
                action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that "In addition to our plan,
                we
                are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require
                access
                to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop
                or
                safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company"[37] GM
                and
                Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding
                provisions.[38]
                <br>
                On December 19, the cost of credit default swaps to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent the sum
                insured for five years in addition to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8 million paid
                upfront
                to insure $10 million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year.[39] In January 2009,
                Ford
                reported a $14.6 billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained
                sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt for equity
                exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash
                position.[40] These actions yielded Ford a $2.7 billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's
                first
                full-year profit in four years.[41] In 2012, Ford's corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to
                investment grade again, citing sustainable, lasting improvements.[42]
                <br>
                On October 29, 2012, Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business, its last
                remaining automotive components operation, to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed
                price.[43]
                <br>
                On November 1, 2012, Ford announced that CEO Alan Mulally will stay with the company until 2014.
                Ford
                also named Mark Fields, the president of operations in Americas, as its new chief operating
                officer[44]
                Ford's CEO Mulally was paid a compensation of over $174 million in his previous seven years at Ford
                since 2006. The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company.[45]
                <br>
                In April 2016, Ford announced a plan to modernize its Dearborn engineering and headquarters campuses
                through a ten-year building project. The end result would see the number of Ford employees working
                in
                these areas doubling, to 24,000. During construction, some 2000 of the employees were relocated out
                of
                the campus to a temporary location in a disused section of the local shopping mall.[46] Facilities
                would
                also be altered to allow ride-sharing and electric and self-driving vehicles.[47] Estimates of the
                construction cost were $1.2 billion.[48]
                <br>
                The historic, once abandoned Michigan Central Station was purchased by Ford Motor Company in May
                2018
                and is expected to undergo a significant four year renovation
                On January 3, 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that in a "vote of confidence" because of the
                pro-business climate being fostered in part by President-elect Donald Trump, Ford has cancelled
                plans to
                invest $1.6 billion in a new plant in Mexico to manufacture the Ford Focus. The Ford Focus will now
                be
                manufactured in the existing plant in Mexico. Instead, Fields announced that Ford will be investing
                $700
                million in Michigan, which it plans to use to create 700 new jobs.[49] Also in 2017, Ford began
                development of a new mixed-use urban campus in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit, with its
                purchase,
                renovation and occupation of The Factory at Michigan and Rosa Parks. The new site was expected to
                have a
                major focus on the development of autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle technology.[50] Ford later
                began buying up other parcels of land in Corktown including a very high-profile purchase of Michigan
                Central Station which is planned to become the hub of their Corktown campus, and the adjacent
                Roosevelt
                Warehouse.[51] Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees, roughly 5 percent of its southeast
                Michigan
                workforce, to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and
                partners.[52] Bill Ford envisioned the first-floor concourse of the train station to be a public
                gathering place with retail outlets and restaurants.[53]
                <br>
                In February 2017, Ford Motor Co. acquired majority ownership of Argo AI, an self-driving car
                startup.[54]
                <br>
                In May 2017, Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company's
                declining
                share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a
                nearly
                10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in
                2018.[55][56]
                Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently
                oversaw
                the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing
                programs,
                self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping Ford better compete with Uber, Alphabet
                Inc.
                and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry.[57][58]
                <br>
                On April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it will discontinue passenger cars in the North American
                market
                in the next four years, except for the Mustang, due to declining demand and profitability.[59] The
                Focus
                Active, a crossover SUV based on the newly-unveiled fourth-generation Focus, was also intended to be
                marketed in the United States. Due to the vehicle being manufactured in China, Ford later announced
                that
                it would not release the Focus Active in the United States, due to tariffs imposed by the Trump
                administration on Chinese exports.

                Audi AG (German: [ˈaʊ̯di ʔaːˈɡeː] (About this soundlisten)) is a German automobile manufacturer that
                designs, engineers, produces, markets and distributes luxury vehicles. Audi is a member of the
                Volkswagen Group and has its roots at Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. Audi-branded vehicles are produced
                in nine production facilities worldwide.
                <br>
                The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises
                (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and
                Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern era of Audi essentially began in
                the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.[10] After relaunching the Audi
                brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU
                Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present day form of the company.
                <br>
                The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. "Horch",
                meaning "listen" in German, becomes "audi" in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one
                of four car companies that banded together to create Audi's predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi's
                slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, meaning "Being Ahead through Technology". However, Audi USA had used
                the slogan "Truth in Engineering" from 2007 to 2016, and have not used the slogan since 2016.[11] Audi,
                along with fellow German marques BMW and Mercedes-Benz, is among the best-selling luxury automobile
                brands in the world.[12]
                <br>
                History
                <br>
                Birth of the company and its name
                Automobile company Wanderer was originally established in 1885, later becoming a branch of Audi AG.
                Another company, NSU, which also later merged into Audi, was founded during this time, and later
                supplied the chassis for Gottlieb Daimler's four-wheeler.[13]
                <br>
                On 14 November, 1899, August Horch (1868–1951) established the company A. Horch & Cie. in the Ehrenfeld
                district of Cologne. In 1902, he moved with his company to Reichenbach im Vogtland. On 10 May, 1904, he
                founded the August Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, a joint-stock company in Zwickau (State of Saxony).
                <br>
                After troubles with Horch chief financial officer, August Horch left Motorwagenwerke and founded in
                Zwickau on 16 July, 1909, his second company, the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH. His former partners
                sued him for trademark infringement. The German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court) in Leipzig,[14] eventually
                determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.[15]
                <br>
                Audi Type E
                <br>
                Since August Horch was prohibited from using "Horch" as a trade name in his new car business, he called
                a meeting with close business friends, Paul and Franz Fikentscher from Zwickau. At the apartment of
                Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting,
                Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on
                the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally
                blurted out, "Father – audiatur et altera pars... wouldn't it be a good idea to call it audi instead of
                horch?"[16] "Horch!" in German means "Hark!" or "hear", which is "Audi" in the singular imperative form
                of "audire" – "to listen" – in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the
                meeting.[17] On 25 April 1910 the Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau (from 1915 on Audiwerke AG Zwickau)
                was entered in the company's register of Zwickau registration court.
                <br>
                The first Audi automobile, the Audi Type A 10/22 hp (16 kW) Sport-Phaeton, was produced in the same
                year,[18] followed by the successor Type B 10/28PS in the same year.[19]
                <br>
                Audi started with a 2,612 cc inline-four engine model Type A, followed by a 3,564 cc model, as well as
                4,680 cc and 5,720 cc models. These cars were successful even in sporting events. The first six-cylinder
                model Type M, 4,655 cc appeared in 1924.[20]
                <br>
                August Horch left the Audiwerke in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport, but he was
                still involved with Audi as a member of the board of trustees. In September 1921, Audi became the first
                German car manufacturer to present a production car, the Audi Type K, with left-handed drive.[21]
                Left-hand drive spread and established dominance during the 1920s because it provided a better view of
                oncoming traffic, making overtaking safer[21] when driving on the right.
                <br>
                The merger of the four companies under the logo of four rings
                <br>
                In August 1928, Jørgen Rasmussen, the owner of Dampf-Kraft-Wagen (DKW), acquired the majority of shares
                in Audiwerke AG.[22] In the same year, Rasmussen bought the remains of the U.S. automobile manufacturer
                Rickenbacker, including the manufacturing equipment for 8-cylinder engines. These engines were used in
                Audi Zwickau and Audi Dresden models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, 6-cylinder and
                4-cylinder (the "four" with a Peugeot engine) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were
                luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.
                <br>
                In 1932, Audi merged with Horch, DKW, and Wanderer, to form Auto Union AG, Chemnitz. It was during this
                period that the company offered the Audi Front that became the first European car to combine a
                six-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive. It used a powertrain shared with the Wanderer, but turned
                180-degrees, so that the drive shaft faced the front.
                <br>
                Before World War II, Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today,
                representing these four brands. However, this badge was used only on Auto Union racing cars in that
                period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became
                more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch or Wanderer built engines.
                <br>
                Reflecting the economic pressures of the time, Auto Union concentrated increasingly on smaller cars
                through the 1930s, so that by 1938 the company's DKW brand accounted for 17.9% of the German car market,
                while Audi held only 0.1%. After the final few Audis were delivered in 1939 the "Audi" name disappeared
                completely from the new car market for more than two decades.
                <br>
                Post-World War II
                <br>
                IFA F9
                Like most German manufacturing, at the onset of World War II the Auto Union plants were retooled for
                military production, and were a target for allied bombing during the war which left them damaged.
                <br>
                Overrun by the Soviet Army in 1945, on the orders of the Soviet Union military administration the
                factories were dismantled as part of war reparations.[23] Following this, the company's entire assets
                were expropriated without compensation.[23] On 17 August 1948, Auto Union AG of Chemnitz was deleted
                from the commercial register.[22] These actions had the effect of liquidating Germany's Auto Union AG.
                The remains of the Audi plant of Zwickau became the VEB (for "People Owned Enterprise") Automobilwerk
                Zwickau [de] or AWZ (in English: Automobile Works Zwickau).
                <br>
                With no prospect of continuing production in Soviet-controlled East Germany, Auto Union executives began
                the process of relocating what was left of the company to West Germany. A site was chosen in Ingolstadt,
                Bavaria, to start a spare parts operation in late 1945, which would eventually serve as the headquarters
                of the reformed Auto Union in 1949.
                <br>
                The former Audi factory in Zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war-models in 1949. These DKW models
                were renamed to IFA F8 and IFA F9 and were similar to the West German versions. West and East German
                models were equipped with the traditional and renowned DKW two-stroke engines. The Zwickau plant
                manufactured the infamous Trabant until 1991, when it came under Volkswagen control—effectively bringing
                it under the same umbrella as Audi since 1945.
                <br>
                New Auto Union unit
                <br>
                A new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt with loans from the Bavarian state
                government and Marshall Plan aid.[23] The reformed company was launched 3 September 1949 and continued
                DKW's tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines.[23] This included
                production of a small but sturdy 125 cc motorcycle and a DKW delivery van, the DKW F89 L at Ingolstadt.
                The Ingolstadt site was large, consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which
                was suitable for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution, but at this stage there
                was at Ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles: for manufacturing the
                company's first post-war mass-market passenger car plant capacity in Düsseldorf was rented from
                Rheinmetall-Borsig. It was only ten years later, after the company had attracted an investor, when funds
                became available for construction of major car plant at the Ingolstadt head office site.
                <br>
                In 1958, in response to pressure from Friedrich Flick, then the company's largest single
                shareholder,[24] Daimler-Benz took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was increased to a
                100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were not the focus of Daimler-Benz's interests, and
                while the early 1960s saw major investment in new Mercedes models and in a state of the art factory for
                Auto Union's, the company's aging model range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the
                early 1960s to the same extent as competitor manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Opel. The decision to
                dispose of the Auto Union business was based on its lack of profitability.[25] Ironically, by the time
                they sold the business, it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern
                four-stroke engine, which would enable the Auto Union business, under a new owner, to embark on a period
                of profitable growth, now producing not Auto Unions or DKWs, but using the "Audi" name, resurrected in
                1965 after a 25-year gap.
                <br>
                In 1964, Volkswagen acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included the new factory in
                Ingolstadt, the DKW and Audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design which had been funded
                by Daimler-Benz, who in return retained the dormant Horch trademark and the Düsseldorf factory which
                became a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant. Eighteen months later, Volkswagen bought complete control of
                Ingolstadt, and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the Ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional
                60,000 Volkswagen Beetles per year.[26] Two-stroke engines became less popular during the 1960s as
                customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines. In September 1965, the DKW F102 was
                fitted with a four-stroke engine and a facelift for the car's front and rear. Volkswagen dumped the DKW
                brand because of its associations with two-stroke technology, and having classified the model internally
                as the F103, sold it simply as the "Audi". Later developments of the model were named after their
                horsepower ratings and sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90, selling until 1972. Initially,
                Volkswagen was hostile to the idea of Auto Union as a standalone entity producing its own models having
                acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the Ingolstadt assembly plant –
                to the point where Volkswagen executives ordered that the Auto Union name and flags bearing the four
                rings were removed from the factory buildings. Then VW chief Heinz Nordhoff explicitly forbade Auto
                Union from any further product development. Fearing that the Volkswagen had no long term ambition for
                the Audi brand, Auto Union engineers under the leadership of Ludwig Kraus developed the first Audi 100
                in secret, without Nordhoff's knowledge. When presented with a finished prototype, Nordhoff was so
                impressed he authorised the car for production, which when launched in 1968, went on to be a huge
                success. With this, the resurrection of the Audi brand was now complete, this being followed by the
                first generation Audi 80 in 1972, which would in turn provide a template for VW's new front-wheel-drive
                water-cooled range which debuted from the mid-1970s onward.

                Audi 80 assembly line in Wolfsburg, 1973
                In 1969, Auto Union merged with NSU, based in Neckarsulm, near Stuttgart. In the 1950s, NSU had been the
                world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles, but had moved on to produce small cars like the NSU Prinz,
                the TT and TTS versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars. NSU then focused on new rotary
                engines based on the ideas of Felix Wankel. In 1967, the new NSU Ro 80 was a car well ahead of its time
                in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, and safety. However, teething problems with the
                rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. The Neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the
                larger Audi models A6 and A8. The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the "quattro GmbH" (from November
                2016 "Audi Sport GmbH"), a subsidiary responsible for development and production of Audi
                high-performance models: the R8 and the "RS" model range.
                <br>
                Modern era
                <br>
                The new merged company was incorporated on 1 January 1969 and was known as Audi NSU Auto Union AG, with
                its headquarters at NSU's Neckarsulm plant, and saw the emergence of Audi as a separate brand for the
                first time since the pre-war era. Volkswagen introduced the Audi brand to the United States for the 1970
                model year. That same year, the mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the K70, originally intended
                to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic NSU Ro 80, was instead launched as a
                Volkswagen.
                <br>
                After the launch of the Audi 100 of 1968, the Audi 80/Fox (which formed the basis for the 1973
                Volkswagen Passat) followed in 1972 and the Audi 50 (later rebadged as the Volkswagen Polo) in 1974. The
                Audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the Golf/Polo concept, one that led
                to a hugely successful world car. Ultimately, the Audi 80 and 100 (progenitors of the A4 and A6,
                respectively) became the company's biggest sellers, whilst little investment was made in the fading NSU
                range; the Prinz models were dropped in 1973 whilst the fatally flawed NSU Ro80 went out of production
                in 1977, spelling the effective end of the NSU brand. Production of the Audi 100 had been steadily moved
                from Ingolstadt to Neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed, any by the appearance of the second
                generation C2 version in 1976, all production was now at the former NSU plant. Neckarsulm from that
                point onward would produce Audi's higher end models.
                <br>
                The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer Jörg
                Bensinger[27] was accepted to develop the four-wheel drive technology in Volkswagen's Iltis military
                vehicle for an Audi performance car and rally racing car. The performance car, introduced in 1980, was
                named the "Audi Quattro", a turbocharged coupé which was also the first German large-scale production
                vehicle to feature permanent all-wheel drive through a centre differential. Commonly referred to as the
                "Ur-Quattro" (the "Ur-" prefix is a German augmentative used, in this case, to mean "original" and is
                also applied to the first generation of Audi's S4 and S6 Sport Saloons, as in "UrS4" and "UrS6"), few of
                these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team), but the model was a great success in
                rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became
                associated with advances in automotive technology.
                <br>
                In 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company's official name was now
                shortened to simply Audi AG. At the same time the company's headquarters moved back to Ingolstadt and
                two new wholly owned subsidiaries; Auto Union GmbH and NSU GmbH, were formed to own and manage the
                historical trademarks and intellectual property of the original constituent companies (the exception
                being Horch, which had been retained by Daimler-Benz after the VW takeover), and to operate Audi's
                heritage operations.
                <br>
                Audi Quattro
                <br>
                In 1986, as the Passat-based Audi 80 was beginning to develop a kind of "grandfather's car" image, the
                type 89 was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and
                dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan
                (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant Audi
                90, which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early 1990s, sales began to slump for the
                Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.
                <br>
                In the early part of the 21st century, Audi set forth on a German racetrack to claim and maintain
                several world records, such as top speed endurance. This effort was in-line with the company's heritage
                from the 1930s racing era Silver Arrows.
                <br>
                Through the early 1990s, Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against German
                automakers Mercedes-Benz and BMW. This began with the release of the Audi V8 in 1990. It was essentially
                a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the
                new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.
                <br>
                By 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder Audi 90 and Audi 100, the turbocharged Audi
                200 and the Audi V8. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4- and 5-cylinder engines.
                <br>
                Although the five-cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant, it was still a little too
                different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a
                2.8L V6 engine. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now
                badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of four-, five-, and six-cylinder engines, in
                Saloon, Coupé and Cabriolet body styles.
                <br>
                The five-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice; however, a turbocharged 230 hp (170 kW)
                version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the
                engine fitted to the Sport Quattro. It was fitted to the Audi Coupé, and named the S2 and also to the
                Audi 100 body, and named the S4. These two models were the beginning of the mass-produced S series of
                performance cars.

                Audi 5000 unintended acceleration allegations
                Sales in the United States fell after a series of recalls from 1982 to 1987 of Audi 5000 models[28]
                associated with reported incidents of sudden unintended acceleration linked to six deaths and 700
                accidents.[28] At the time, NHTSA was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden
                surges of power.[29]
                <br>
                A 60 Minutes report aired 23 November 1986,[30] featuring interviews with six people who had sued Audi
                after reporting unintended acceleration, showing an Audi 5000 ostensibly suffering a problem when the
                brake pedal was pushed.[31][32] Subsequent investigation revealed that 60 Minutes had engineered the
                failure – fitting a canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor, linked via a hose to a hole
                drilled into the transmission.[30]
                <br>
                Audi 100 C3, sold as the Audi 5000 in the U.S.
                <br>
                Audi contended, prior to findings by outside investigators,[29] that the problems were caused by driver
                error, specifically pedal misapplication.[29] Subsequently, the National Highway Traffic Safety
                Administration (NHTSA) concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases, including all the
                ones that prompted the 60 Minutes report, were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals.[33]
                CBS did not acknowledge the test results of involved government agencies, but did acknowledge the
                similar results of another study.[31]
                <br>
                In a review study published in 2012, NHTSA summarized its past findings about the Audi unintended
                acceleration problems: "Once an unintended acceleration had begun, in the Audi 5000, due to a failure in
                the idle-stabilizer system (producing an initial acceleration of 0.3g), pedal misapplication resulting
                from panic, confusion, or unfamiliarity with the Audi 5000 contributed to the severity of the
                incident."[34]
                <br>
                This summary is consistent with the conclusions of NHTSA's most technical analysis at the time: "Audi
                idle-stabilization systems were prone to defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief
                unanticipated accelerations of up to 0.3g [which is similar in magnitude to an emergency stop in a
                subway car]. These accelerations could not be the sole cause of [(long-duration) sudden acceleration
                incidents (SAI)], but might have triggered some SAIs by startling the driver.[35] The defective
                idle-stabilization system performed a type of electronic throttle control. Significantly: multiple
                "intermittent malfunctions of the electronic control unit were observed and recorded ... and [were also
                observed and] reported by Transport Canada."[35]
                <br>
                With a series of recall campaigns, Audi made several modifications; the first adjusted the distance
                between the brake and accelerator pedal on automatic-transmission models.[28] Later repairs, of 250,000
                cars dating back to 1978, added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting
                out of park.[28] A legacy of the Audi 5000 and other reported cases of sudden unintended acceleration
                are intricate gear stick patterns and brake interlock mechanisms to prevent inadvertent shifting into
                forward or reverse. It is unclear how the defects in the idle-stabilization system were addressed.
                <br>
                Audi's U.S. sales, which had reached 74,061 in 1985, dropped to 12,283 in 1991 and remained level for
                three years.[28] – with resale values falling dramatically.[36] Audi subsequently offered increased
                warranty protection[36] and renamed the affected models – with the 5000 becoming the 100 and 200 in
                1989[29] – and reached the same sales levels again only by model year 2000.[28]

                A 2010 BusinessWeek article – outlining possible parallels between Audi's experience and 2009–2010
                Toyota vehicle recalls – noted a class-action lawsuit filed in 1987 by about 7,500 Audi 5000-model
                owners remains unsettled and remains contested in Chicago's Cook County after appeals at the Illinois
                state and U.S. federal levels.[28]

                Model introductions
                <br>
                In the mid-to-late 1990s, Audi introduced new technologies including the use of aluminium construction.
                Produced from 1999 to 2005, the Audi A2 was a futuristic super mini, born from the Al2 concept, with
                many features that helped regain consumer confidence, like the aluminium space frame, which was a first
                in production car design. In the A2 Audi further expanded their TDI technology through the use of frugal
                three-cylinder engines. The A2 was extremely aerodynamic and was designed around a wind tunnel. The Audi
                A2 was criticised for its high price and was never really a sales success but it planted Audi as a
                cutting-edge manufacturer. The model, a Mercedes-Benz A-Class competitor, sold relatively well in
                Europe. However, the A2 was discontinued in 2005 and Audi decided not to develop an immediate
                replacement.
                <br>
                The next major model change came in 1995 when the Audi A4 replaced the Audi 80. The new nomenclature
                scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the Audi A6 (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4
                became the S6 and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The Audi Cabriolet
                continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A
                new A3 hatchback model (sharing the Volkswagen Golf Mk4's platform) was introduced to the range in 1996,
                and the radical Audi TT coupé and roadster were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings.
                <br>
                The engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L four-cylinder, 1.8 L
                four-cylinder turbo, 2.6 L and 2.8 L V6, 2.2 L turbo-charged five-cylinder and the 4.2 L V8 engine. The
                V6s were replaced by new 2.4 L and 2.8 L 30V V6s in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and
                smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7 L V8 and 6.0 L W12 engine for the
                A8.

                Audi AG today
                <br>
                Audi's sales grew strongly in the 2000s, with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to
                1,003,000 in 2008. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and
                the Middle East (+58.5%). China in particular has become a key market, representing 108,000 out of
                705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009. One factor for its popularity in China is
                that Audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the Chinese government for officials, and
                purchases by the government are responsible for 20% of its sales in China.[37] As of late 2009, Audi's
                operating profit of €1.17-billion ($1.85-billion) made it the biggest contributor to parent Volkswagen
                Group's nine-month operating profit of €1.5-billion, while the other marques in Group such as Bentley
                and SEAT had suffered considerable losses.[38] May 2011 saw record sales for Audi of America with the
                new Audi A7 and Audi A3 TDI Clean Diesel.[39] In May 2012, Audi reported a 10% increase in its
                sales—from 408 units to 480 in the last year alone.[40]
                <br>
                Audi manufactures vehicles in seven plants around the world, some of which are shared with other VW
                Group marques[41] although many sub-assemblies such as engines and transmissions are manufactured within
                other Volkswagen Group plants.
                <br>
                Audi's two principal assembly plants are:
                <br>
                Ingolstadt, Opened by Auto Union in 1964, (A3, A4, A5, Q5)
                Neckarsulm, Acquired from NSU in 1969 (A4, A6, A7, A8, R8 & all RS variants)
                Outside of Germany, Audi produces vehicles at:
                <br>
                Aurangabad, India since 2006
                Bratislava, Slovakia, shared with Volkswagen, SEAT, Škoda and Porsche (Q7)
                Brussels, Belgium, acquired from Volkswagen in 2007 (A1)
                Changchun, China since 1995
                Győr, Hungary, (TT and some A3 variants)
                Jakarta, Indonesia since 2011
                Martorell, Spain shared with SEAT and Volkswagen (Q3)
                San José Chiapa, Mexico (2nd gen Q5)
                In September 2012, Audi announced the construction of its first North American manufacturing plant in
                Puebla, Mexico. This plant became operative in 2016 and produces the second generation Q5.[42]
                <br>
                From 2002 up to 2003, Audi headed the Audi Brand Group, a subdivision of the Volkswagen Group's
                Automotive Division consisting of Audi, Lamborghini and SEAT, that was focused on sporty values, with
                the marques' product vehicles and performance being under the higher responsibility of the Audi brand.
                <br>
                On January 2014, Audi, along with the Wireless Power Consortium, operated a booth which demonstrated a
                phone compartment using the Qi open interface standard at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).[43] In
                May, most of the Audi dealers in UK falsely claimed that the Audi A7, A8, and R8 were Euro NCAP safety
                tested, all achieving five out of five stars. In fact none were tested.[44]
                <br>
                In 2015, Audi admitted that at least 2.1 million Audi cars had been involved in the Volkswagen emissions
                testing scandal in which software installed in the cars manipulated emissions data to fool regulators
                and allow the cars to pollute at higher than government-mandated levels. The A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3
                and Q5 models were implicated in the scandal.[45] Audi promised to quickly find a technical solution and
                upgrade the cars so they can function within emissions regulations.[46] Ulrich Hackenberg, the head of
                research and development at Audi, was suspended in relation to the scandal.[47] Despite widespread media
                coverage about the scandal through the month of September, Audi reported that U.S. sales for the month
                had increased by 16.2%.[48] Audi's parent company Volkswagen announced on 18 June 2018 that Audi chief
                executive Rupert Stadler had been arrested.[49]
                <br>
                In November 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implicated the 3-liter diesel engine versions
                of the 2016 Audi A6 Quattro, A7 Quattro, A8, A8L and the Q5 as further models that had emissions
                regulation defeat-device software installed.[50] Thus, these models emitted nitrogen oxide at up to nine
                times the legal limit when the car detected that it was not hooked up to emissions testing
                equipment.[51]
                <br>
                In November 2016, Audi expressed an intention to establish an assembly factory in Pakistan, with the
                company's local partner acquiring land for a plant in Korangi Creek Industrial Park in Karachi. Approval
                of the plan would lead to an investment of $30 million in the new plant.

                Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [lamborˈɡiːni]) is an Italian brand and
                manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the
                Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.
                <br>
                Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A.
                in 1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari. The company gained wide acclaim in 1966
                for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout
                for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales
                plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership
                changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took
                control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian
                group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen
                Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.
                <br>
                New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw
                an increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and
                the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent.
                <br>
                Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Huracán along with the Urus
                SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore
                powerboat racing. Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in
                Pieve di Cento, Italy and continues to produce tractors.

                <br>
                Ferruccio Lamborghini with a Jarama and a tractor of his brand
                Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of
                producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as
                Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s and were noted
                for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports
                coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance
                cars of the era.
                <br>
                Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide
                financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to
                Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was
                placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the
                company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in the company's expansion. Under the Mimrans'
                management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and
                the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle.
                <br>
                The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the
                Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment
                group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power
                sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi
                division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the
                market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the
                worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly
                50 percent.

                Lamborghini Urus
                As of the 2018 model year, Lamborghini's automobile product range consists of three model lines, two of
                which are mid-engine two-seat sports cars while the third one is a front engined, all-wheel drive
                SUV.[4] The V12-powered Aventador line consists of the LP 740–4 Aventador S coupé and roadster.[5] The
                V10-powered Huracán line currently includes the all-wheel-drive LP 610-4 coupé and spyder, the low cost
                rear-wheel-drive LP 580-2 coupé and spyder and the most powerful, track oriented LP 640-4 Performanté
                coupé and spyder.[6] With the intention of doubling its sales volume by 2019, Lamborghini also added an
                SUV named Urus in its line-up which is powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine and utilises a front engine,
                all-wheel drive layout.[7][8]

                Motori Marini Lamborghini produces a large V12 marine engine block for use in World Offshore Series
                Class 1 powerboats. A Lamborghini branded marine engine displaces approximately 8,171 cc (8.2 L) and
                outputs approximately 940 hp (700 kW).[9]

                Lamborghini motorcycle
                In the mid-1980s, Lamborghini produced a limited-production run of a 1,000 cc sports motorcycle. UK
                weekly newspaper Motor Cycle News reported in 1994 – when featuring an example available through an
                Essex motorcycle retailer – that 24 examples were produced with a Lamborghini alloy frame having
                adjustable steering head angle, Kawasaki GPz1000RX engine/transmission unit, Ceriani front forks and
                Marvic wheels. The bodywork was plastic and fully integrated with front fairing merged into fuel tank
                and seat cover ending in a rear tail-fairing. The motorcycles were designed by Lamborghini stylists and
                produced by French business Boxer Bikes.[10]

                Branded merchandise
                Lamborghini licenses its brand to manufacturers that produce a variety of Lamborghini-branded consumer
                goods including scale models, clothing, accessories, bags, electronics[11] and laptop computers.[12]

                Motorsport
                <br>
                The Miura began as a clandestine prototype, a car that had racing pedigree in a company that was
                entirely against motorsport.
                In contrast to his rival Enzo Ferrari, Ferruccio Lamborghini had decided early on that there would be no
                factory-supported racing of Lamborghinis, viewing motorsport as too expensive and too draining on
                company resources.[13] This was unusual for the time, as many sports car manufacturers sought to
                demonstrate the speed, reliability, and technical superiority through motorsport participation. Enzo
                Ferrari in particular was known for considering his road car business mostly a source of funding for his
                participation in motor racing. Ferruccio's policy led to tensions between him and his engineers, many of
                whom were racing enthusiasts; some had previously worked at Ferrari. When Dallara, Stanzani, and Wallace
                began dedicating their spare time to the development of the P400 prototype, they designed it to be a
                road car with racing potential, one that could win on the track and also be driven on the road by
                enthusiasts.[14] When Ferruccio discovered the project, he allowed them to go ahead, seeing it as a
                potential marketing device for the company, while insisting that it would not be raced. The P400 went on
                to become the Miura. The closest the company came to building a true race car under Lamborghini's
                supervision were a few highly modified prototypes, including those built by factory test driver Bob
                Wallace, such as the Miura SV-based "Jota" and the Jarama S-based "Bob Wallace Special".
                <br>
                In the mid-1970s, while Lamborghini was under the management of Georges-Henri Rossetti, Lamborghini
                entered into an agreement with BMW to develop, then manufacture 400 cars for BMW in order to meet Group
                4 homologation requirements. BMW lacked experience developing a mid-engined vehicle and believed that
                Lamborghini's experience in that area would make Lamborghini an ideal choice of partner. Due to
                Lamborghini's shaky finances, Lamborghini fell behind schedule developing the car's structure and
                running gear. When Lamborghini failed to deliver working prototypes on time, BMW took the program in
                house, finishing development without Lamborghini. BMW contracted with Baur to produce the car, which BMW
                named the M1, delivering the first vehicle in October 1978.[15][16]
                <br>
                The 1990 Lotus 102 featured a Lamborghini V12.
                In 1985, Lamborghini's British importer developed the Countach QVX, in conjunction with Spice
                Engineering, for the 1986 Group C championship season. One car was built, but lack of sponsorship caused
                it to miss the season. The QVX competed in only one race, the non-championship 1986 Southern Suns 500 km
                race at Kyalami in South Africa, driven by Tiff Needell. Despite the car finishing better than it
                started, sponsorship could once again not be found and the programme was cancelled.[17]
                <br>
                Lamborghini was an engine supplier in Formula One for the 1989 through 1993 Formula One seasons. It
                supplied engines to Larrousse (1989–1990,1992–1993), Lotus (1990), Ligier (1991), Minardi (1992), and to
                the Modena team in 1991. While the latter is commonly referred to as a factory team, the company saw
                themselves as a supplier, not a backer. The 1992 Larrousse–Lamborghini was largely uncompetitive but
                noteworthy in its tendency to spew oil from its exhaust system. Cars following closely behind the
                Larrousse were commonly coloured yellowish-brown by the end of the race.[18] Lamborghini's best result
                was achieved with Larrousse at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix, when Aguri Suzuki finished third on home
                soil.[19]
                <br>
                In late 1991, a Lamborghini Formula One motor was used in the Konrad KM-011 Group C sports car, but the
                car only lasted a few races before the project was canceled. The same engine, re-badged a Chrysler,
                Lamborghini's then-parent company, was tested by McLaren towards the end of the 1993 season, with the
                intent of using it during the 1994 season. Although driver Ayrton Senna was reportedly impressed with
                the engine's performance, McLaren pulled out of negotiations, choosing a Peugeot engine instead, and
                Chrysler ended the project.

                A Murcielago R-GT participating in the FIA GT Championship at Silverstone in 2006
                Two racing versions of the Diablo were built for the Diablo Supertrophy, a single-model racing series
                held annually from 1996 to 1999. In the first year, the model used in the series was the Diablo SVR,
                while the Diablo 6.0 GTR was used for the remaining three years.[20][21] Lamborghini developed the
                Murciélago R-GT as a production racing car to compete in the FIA GT Championship, the Super GT
                Championship and the American Le Mans Series in 2004. The car's highest placing in any race that year
                was the opening round of the FIA GT Championship at Valencia, where the car entered by Reiter
                Engineering finished third from a fifth-place start.[22][23] In 2006, during the opening round of the
                Super GT championship at Suzuka, a car run by the Japan Lamborghini Owners Club garnered the first
                victory (in class) by an R-GT. A GT3 version of the Gallardo has been developed by Reiter
                Engineering.[24] A Murciélago R-GT entered by All-Inkl.com racing, driven by Christophe Bouchut and
                Stefan Mücke, won the opening round of the FIA GT Championship held at Zhuhai International Circuit,
                achieving the first major international race victory for Lamborghini.[25]

                Marketing
                <br>
                Brand identity
                <br>
                The Lamborghini wordmark, as displayed on the back of its cars
                The world of bullfighting is a key part of Lamborghini's identity.[26][27][28] In 1962, Ferruccio
                Lamborghini visited the Seville ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting
                bulls. Lamborghini, a Taurus himself, was so impressed by the majestic Miura animals that he decided to
                adopt a raging bull as the emblem for the automaker he would open shortly.[29]
                <br>
                Vehicle nomenclature
                After producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini once again turned to the bull
                breeder for inspiration. Don Eduardo was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a
                car for his family and their line of bulls; the fourth Miura to be produced was unveiled to him at his
                ranch in Seville.[29][30]
                <br>
                The automaker would continue to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was
                named for the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. Espada is the Spanish word
                for sword, sometimes used to refer to the bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special
                double meaning; though it was intended to refer only to the historic bullfighting region in Spain,
                Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track.[31]
                <br>
                The Diablo (background) was named for a legendary bull, while the Countach (foreground) broke from the
                bullfighting tradition.
                After christening the Urraco after a bull breed, in 1974, Lamborghini broke from tradition, naming the
                About this soundCountach (help·info) not for a bull,[32] but for contacc (pronounced [kʊŋˈtɑtʃ]), a
                Piedmontese expletive.[32] Legend has it that stylist Nuccio Bertone uttered the word in surprise when
                he first saw the Countach prototype, "Project 112".[33] The LM002 (LM for Lamborghini Militaire) sport
                utility vehicle and the Silhouette (named after the popular racing category of the time) were other
                exceptions to the tradition.
                <br>
                The Jalpa of 1982 was named for a bull breed; Diablo, for the Duke of Veragua's ferocious bull famous
                for fighting an epic battle against El Chicorro in Madrid in 1869;[34][35][36] Murciélago, the legendary
                bull whose life was spared by El Lagartijo for his performance in 1879; Gallardo, named for one of the
                five ancestral castes of the Spanish fighting bull breed;[37] and Reventón, the bull that defeated young
                Mexican torero Félix Guzmán in 1943. The Estoque concept of 2008 was named for the estoc, the sword
                traditionally used by matadors during bullfights.[38]

                Concept vehicles
                <br>
                The Concept S, a Gallardo derivative
                Throughout its history, Lamborghini has envisioned and presented a variety of concept cars, beginning in
                1963 with the very first Lamborghini prototype, the 350GTV. Other famous models include Bertone's 1967
                Marzal, 1974 Bravo, and 1980 Athon, Chrysler's 1987 Portofino, the Italdesign-styled Cala from 1995, the
                Zagato-built Raptor from 1996.
                <br>
                A retro-styled Lamborghini Miura concept car, the first creation of chief designer Walter de'Silva, was
                presented in 2006. President and CEO Stephan Winkelmann denied that the concept would be put into
                production, saying that the Miura concept was "a celebration of our history, but Lamborghini is about
                the future. Retro design is not what we are here for. So we won’t do the [new] Miura.”[39]
                <br>
                At the 2008 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini revealed the Estoque, a four-door sedan concept. Although
                there had been much speculation regarding the Estoque's eventual production,[40][41] Lamborghini
                management has not made a decision regarding production of what might be the first four-door car to roll
                out of the Sant'Agata factory.[42]
                <br>
                The Estoque, a 2008 sedan concept
                At the 2010 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Sesto Elemento. The concept car is made almost
                entirely of carbon fibre making it extremely light, with a weight of 999 kg (2,202 lb). The Sesto
                Elemento shares the same V10 engine found in the Lamborghini Gallardo. Lamborghini hopes to signal a
