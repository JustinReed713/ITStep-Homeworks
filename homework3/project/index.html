                            A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions
                            of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and
                            mainly transport people rather than goods.

                            Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.
                            The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz
                            patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
                            One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car
                            manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they
                            replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western
                            Europe and other parts of the world.

                        <p>
                            A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to
                            generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a TV
                            screen, virtual reality headset or computer monitor. Since the 1980s, video games have
                            become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry, and whether they are
                            also a form of art is a matter of dispute.

                            The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms. Video games are
                            developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others.
                            Specialized platforms such as arcade games, which present the game in a large, typically
                            coin-operated chassis, were common in the 1980s in video arcades, but declined in popularity
                            as other, more affordable platforms became available. These include dedicated devices such
                            as video game consoles, as well as general-purpose computers like a laptop, desktop or
                            handheld computing devices.

                            The input device used for games, the game controller, varies across platforms. Common
                            controllers include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, the touchscreens of
                            mobile devices, or even a person's body, using a Kinect sensor. Players view the game on a
                            display device such as a television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality
                            head-mounted display goggles. There are often game sound effects, music and voice actor
                            lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones. Some games in the 2000s include haptic,
                            vibration-creating effects, force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets.

                            In the 2010s, the commercial importance of the video game industry is increasing. The
                            emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are driving the growth
                            of the industry. As of 2018, video games generated sales of US$134.9 billion annually
                            worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind
                            broadcast and cable TV.

                            Typical process for designing a printed circuit board according to a ready-made circuit
                            diagram:
                            <br>
                            Preparation for design:
                            Import a circuit diagram into a CAD database for a circuit board. As a rule, the preparation
                            of the circuit is performed in a separate CAD circuit. Some CAD packages contain components
                            of both circuitry and design. Other PCB CAD systems do not have a circuit editor in their
                            composition, only importing a circuit diagram of popular formats.
                            Input of components into CAD (drawings of each component, location and purpose of outputs,
                            etc.). Usually, they use off-the-shelf component libraries provided by CAD developers.
                            Clarification by the future manufacturer of the printed circuit board of its technological
                            capabilities (available materials, number of layers, accuracy class, permissible hole
                            diameters, the possibility of coatings, etc.). Based on these data, a preliminary selection
                            is made of the board material, the number of metallization layers, the thickness of the
                            material and foil, the accuracy class and they are also the initial data for configuring the
                            DRC (see below) used both for automatic wiring and for checking the diluted board. Most
                            often, optimal foil fiberglass 1.5 mm thick with a foil thickness of 18 or 35 microns.
                            <br>
                            Board Design:
                            Determination of the design of the printed circuit board (contour and overall dimensions,
                            mounting holes, maximum permissible height of the components). Drawing dimensions (edges) of
                            the board, cutouts and mounting holes, areas of the prohibition of the placement of
                            components. Placement of structurally attached parts: connectors, indicators, buttons, etc.
                            Defining the rules for the location of critical conductors: identifying areas for laying
                            high-current conductors and power buses; arrangement of high-frequency and differential
                            lines, determination of methods for laying and shielding noise-sensitive circuits and
                            circuits - sources of interference.
                            Perform automatic or manual component placement. Usually they tend to place all components
                            on one side of the board, since two-sided installation of parts is noticeably more expensive
                            to manufacture.
                            Start automatic tracer. In case of unsatisfactory result - re-placement of components. These
                            two steps are often performed tens or hundreds of times in a row. In some cases, tracing of
                            printed circuit boards (drawing tracks) is done manually in whole or in part.
                            Checking the board for errors (DRC, Design Rules Check): checking for gaps, short circuits,
                            component overlays, etc.
                            In some cases, the calculation of the mechanical properties of the resulting printed circuit
                            board is required: the frequency of intrinsic mechanical resonance and impact strength. If
                            necessary, change the reference points of the board or the placement of heavy components.
                            <br>
                            Creation of output design documentation:
                            Export the file to a format accepted by the PCB manufacturer, for example, Gerber;
                            Design documentation, in accordance with current standards, which specifies the technical
                            requirements for the manufacture of printed circuit boards: the name of the material of the
                            foil base, the drilling diameters of all types of holes, the type of vias (closed with a
                            solder mask or open, tinned), areas of galvanic coatings and their type, color solder mask
                            and its type, the need for marking, the method of processing the circuit board (milling or
                            scribing), etc. In agreement with the manufacturer, the requirements may indicate camping in
                            the accompanying note.

                            Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done
                            by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or
                            without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively
                            short stays between successive movements.

                        <p>
                            Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface,
                            through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that
                            data.
                            A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web
                            technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open Web Platform or
                            act as compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e., React Native).

                            Typically, a person enters into the field of front-end development by learning to develop
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which commonly runs in a web browser but can also run in a
                            headless browser, WebView, or as compilation input for a native runtime environment. These
                            four run times scenarios are explained below.
